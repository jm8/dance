# Dance

Personal fork of [this pr](https://github.com/71/dance/pull/338) for dance
with additional features

Custom additional features:

- Space menu
- Surround add, surround replace, surround delete
- ]d and [d for jumping to diagnostics

To install:

```
npm run vscode:prepublish
npm run package:pre
npm run package-helix:pre
```
note to self:
Install the `dance` vcix FIRST, then the `dance-helix-keybindings`
otherwise will not work
